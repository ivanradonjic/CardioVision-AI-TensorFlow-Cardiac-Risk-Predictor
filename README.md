# CardioVision-AI-TensorFlow-Cardiac-Risk-Predictor-
Welcome to the CardioVision AI project repository. This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning model using TensorFlow to predict heart disease in patients. The final model achieved an accuracy of 85.33% with a recall rate of 90%. The repository includes the final report, dataset, and several Python files for different stages of the project.

The dataset used in this study comprises various medical parameters. These features are critical indicators of cardiovascular health and are used to train and evaluate the predictive model. The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process involves summarizing the dataset's main features using visual methods to identify trends, patterns, and potential anomalies. The EDA_HeartDisease Jupyter Notebook file contains the code for generating histograms and various plots to visualize the distribution of key variables.

Various model structures were rigorously tested to determine the most effective approach. These structures ranged from simple feedforward networks to more complex architectures. Parameter optimization focused on refining regularization and learning rates to enhance model performance. The implementation details for all studies are provided in the Parameter_Optimization_HeartDisease Jupyter Notebook file.

The final model incorporates the best-performing neural network structure and optimized parameters. Detailed analysis and results can be found in the Final_Model_HeartDisease Jupyter Notebook file.

The final report ties everything together, providing a comprehensive overview of the project's objectives, methodologies, and findings. It serves as a detailed document that encapsulates the entire workflow, from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model selection, optimization, and final evaluation. This cohesive narrative ensures that all aspects of the project are thoroughly documented and easily accessible.
